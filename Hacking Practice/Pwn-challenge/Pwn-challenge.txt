**chall.c**: the source code 


**compile command**: gcc -m32 -o chall chall.c


**chall**: compiled executable file


* As a remark, we deployed the challenge on ubuntu:20.04

There are some vulnerabilities in this program, try to exploit them to execute `getflag` function (which will read and output the flag)

*hint1: to write a exploit script, we recommend you to use python2 and the pwntools library to interact with executable. The link is here: [pwntools](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/latest/)*

*hint2: to find the offset of `getflag` you may need disassembly tools*

*hint3: processes that created by `fork` have the same memory layout, even the canary; the parent process would not crash when some children processes crash*
